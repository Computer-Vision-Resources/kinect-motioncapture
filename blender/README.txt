* A Blender project to visualise the angle data obtained from the Kinect

* This project reuses code from the Hackaday Project - http://hackaday.com/2016/01/23/amazing-imu-based-motion-capture-suit-turns-you-into-a-cartoon/

* The project was run using Blender 2.78 on Ubuntu 14.04

* To run this project open MotionSuit.blend and press 'p' with focus on the 3D
view window. Open blender through a terminal to view debug info. The run can
be stopped by pressing 'ESC'.

* This has to be run along with the MotionCapture processing sketch. Make sure
* the port numbers in both the projects are identical
